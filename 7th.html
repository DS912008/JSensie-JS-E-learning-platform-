                <h4>Variables are Containers for Storing Data</h4>
                <p>JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:<ul>
                    <li>
                        Automatically
                    </li>
                    <li>Using <span>Var</span></li>
                    <li>Using <span>let</span></li>
                    <li>Using <span>const</span></li>
                </ul></p>
            </div>
            In this first example,<span> x, y, and z </span> undeclared variables.

They are automatically declared when first used:
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow">Note:<br>It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.</p>
<p>From the examples you can guess:<ul>
    <li>x stores the value 5</li>
    <li>y stores the value 6</li>
    <li>z stores the value 11</li>
</ul>
<div class="example"></div></p>

<section class="section3">
    <p class="yellow">
        Note:<br>The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.<br><br>

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.<br><br>

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
    </p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <p>The two variables <span>price1</span> and <span>price2</span> are declared with the <span>const</span> keyword.<br><br>

These are constant values and cannot be changed.<br><br>

The variable <span>total</span> is declared with the <span>let</span> keyword.<br><br>

The value <span>total</span> can be changed.</p>

        <strong>When to Use var, let, or const?</strong><br><br>
        1. Always declare variables<br>

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed<br>

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)<br>

4. Only use let if you can't use const<br>

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers

    <h3>Just Like Algebra</h3>
    <p>Just like in algebra, variables hold values:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <p>Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <p>From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Variables are containers for storing values.
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>JavaScript Identifiers<br></h3>
    <p>All JavaScript <strong>variables</strong> must be <strong>identified</strong> with <strong>unique names</strong>.<br><br>

These unique names are called <strong>identifiers.</strong><br><br>

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).<br><br>

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
<uL>
    <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
     <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
      <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).</li>
       <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).</li>
        <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
</uL></p>
<p class="yellow">
    <strong>Note:</strong><br>
    JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
</p>

    <h3>The Assignment Operator</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (<span>=</span>) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.<br><br>

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)</p>
<p class="yellow"><strong>Note:<br><br></strong>
The "equal to" operator is written like <span>==</span> in JavaScript.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>JavaScript Data Types</h3>
    JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".<br><br>

In programming, text values are called text strings.<br><br>

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.<br><br>

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.<br><br>

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
<div class="example"></div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Declaring a JavaScript Variable</h3>
    <p>Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the <span>var</span> or the <span>let</span> keyword:</p>
<div class="example"></div> <br>
or<br>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is <span>undefined</span>).

To <strong>assign</strong> a value to the variable, use the equal sign:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
In the example below, we create a variable called <span>carName</span> and assign the value "Volvo" to it.<br><br>

Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow"><strong>Note:<br></strong>It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>
        One Statement, Many Variables
    </h3>
    <p>You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with <span>let</span> and separate the variables by <strong>comma</strong></p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>A declaration can span multiple lines:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Value = undefined</h3>
    In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.<br><br>

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.<br><br>

The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
<div class="example"></div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
<br><br>
The variable <span>carName</span> will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:</h3>
<div class="example"></div>
</section>
<section>
    <div class="yellow">
        <strong>Note:<br></strong>
        You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

This will not work:<br> 
<p class="white">
    let carName = "Volvo";<br>
let carName;
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>JavaScript Arithmetic</h3><br>
    <p>As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like <span>=</span> and <span>+</span>:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <p>You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    Also try this:
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow"><strong>Note:<br></strong>If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.</p>
Now try this:
<div class="example"></div>

</section>
<section>
    <h3>JavaScript Dollar Sign $</h3>
    <p>Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    <p>Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function <span>$</span> is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery <span>$("p")</span>; means "select all p elements".</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>JavaScript Underscore (_)</h3>
    <p>Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:</p>
    <div class="example"></div>
    Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.
