    JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.<br>
    <br>

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

<section class="section2">
    <h3>Single Line Comments</h3>
    <p>Single line comments start with <span>//.</span><br>
    <br>

Any text between <span>// </span>and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).<br>
    <br>

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:
<div class="example"></div>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Multi-line Comments</h3>
<p>
    Multi-line comments start with <span>/*</span> and end with <span>*/</span>.<br>
    <br>

Any text between <span>/*</span> and <span>*/ </span> will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow">It is most common to use single line comments.<br>
Block comments are often used for formal documentation.</p>

<section class="section4">
    <h3>Using Comments to Prevent Execution</h3>
    <p>Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

Adding <span>//</span> in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.

This example uses // to prevent execution of one of the code lines:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of multiple lines:
<div class="example"></div>
