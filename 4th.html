    <h3>JavaScript Programs</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong> computer program</strong>s a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.<br><br>

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called <strong>statements.</strong><br><br>
A <strong>JavaScript program</strong> is a list of JavaScript <strong>statements.</strong>.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="yellow">In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.</p>
</section>
 <section class="section3">
    <h3>JavaScript Statements</h3>
    <p>JavaScript statements are composed of:<br><br>

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.<br><br>

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.<br><br>

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.</p>
<p class="yellow">JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section4">
    <h3>JavaScript Semicolons ;</h3>
    <p>Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.<br><br>

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow">On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.<br><br>
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.</p>
 </section>
 

 <section class="section5">
    <h3>JavaScript White Space</h3>
    <p>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.<br><br>

The following lines are equivalent:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p>A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):</p>
<div class="example"></div>
 </section>
 <section class="section6">
    <h3>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h3>
    <p>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.<br><br>

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
 </section>
 <section class="section7">
    <h3>JavaScript Code Blocks</h3>
    <p>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.<br><br>

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. <br><br>

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:</p>
<div class="example"></div>
<p class="yellow">In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks.<br><br>
You will learn more about functions later in this tutorial.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section8">
    <h3>JavaScript Keywords</h3>
    <p>JavaScript statements often start with a <strong>keyword</strong> to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:</p>
<section>
<table >
    <tr>
        <td class="w"><strong>var</strong></td>
        <td class="w">Declares a variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="g"><strong>let</strong></td>
        <td>Declares a block variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="w"><strong>const</strong></td>
        <td class="w">Declares a block constant</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>if</strong></td>
        <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td  class="w"> <strong>switch</strong></td>
        <td class="w">Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td ><strong>for</strong></td>
        <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td  class="w"> <strong>function</strong></td>
        <td class="w">Declares a function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>return</strong></td>
        <td>Exits a function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td  class="w" ><strong>try</strong></td>
        <td class="w">Implements error handling to a block of statements</td>
    </tr>
